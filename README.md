# WaitingRoom
The Waiting Room App is designed to revolutionize the process of managing patient information and appointments within healthcare institutions. By creating a centralized database for medical records, the app aims to streamline the sharing of paper files among clinics, eliminating the need for manual approvals and faxing. Key features include standardized pre-visit questionnaires, streamlined appointment scheduling, and enhanced data security through Firebase storage. The design prioritizes usability and simplicity, with a minimalist UI and intuitive navigation. The app leverages Firebase Firestore for data storage, Firebase Authentication for secure user access, and the Flutter framework for cross-platform development. A proposed qualitative study will evaluate user experience and data quality, informing iterative improvements to ensure the app remains at the forefront of modern healthcare management. Through technological excellence and user-centered design, the Waiting Room App embodies a paradigm shift towards efficient and secure healthcare administration.
